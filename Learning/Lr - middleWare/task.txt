So in this project we are designing our own rest api (JSON).

tasks will be:

0. GET /users - HTML HTML document render DONE
1. GET /api/users - List all the users JSON DONE
2. GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with the ID 1 DONE
3. GET /api/users/2 - Get the user with the ID 2 DONE

dynamic path parameters
GET /api/users/:id DONE

id: - variable / dynamic DONE

4. POST /api/users - Create new user
5. PATCH /api/users/1 - EDIT the user with the ID 1
6. DELETE /api/users/1 - DELETE the user with ID 1

- req.params is used to access parameters in the route path, which are placeholders in the URL that can be matched to values. For example, in the route app.get('/users/:id', ...), ":id" is a parameter and the value can be accessed using req.params.id.
