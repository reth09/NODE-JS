RESTFULL API

-it basically got some rules.
- so basically there are some standards that we should follow that are consider as good practices.

1. server and architecture
    - if our client is a browser will always send html to render the site.
        - res.send();
        - res.render();
        - its SSR - SERVER SITE RENDERING 
        - its faster than then the json formate CSR because it render the data directly it doesn't need to fetch it first.

    - if our client is in a MERN stack form than will send data in JSON format.
        - res.JSON();
        - its CSR - CLIENT SITE RENDERING 
        - its slower than SSR because it fetch the data first than render it with react or anything else 

2. always respect all http methods.
    - POST
    - GET
    - PUT
    - PATCH
    - DELETE
